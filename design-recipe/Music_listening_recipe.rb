# 1. Describe the Problem
# Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

# As a user
# So that I can keep track of my music listening
# I want to add tracks I've listened to and see a list of them.

# 2. Design the Class Interface
# Include the initializer and public methods with all parameters and return values.

# class playlist 
# initializer - empty array
#     method add - should add (a) track(s) of music and return the total playlist 


# # 3. Create Examples as Tests
# # Make a list of examples of how the class will behave in different situations.
# # Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go.

# add() is empty => Returns error - add cannot be empty
# add('DNA') => adds 'DNA' to the initialized array that contains all playlists
# add('DNA', 'POWER', 'STRONGER') to the initialized array 
# add(true) => Throws error, type must be a string
# add(2341) => throws error, type must be a string


# 4. Implement the Behaviour
# After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
