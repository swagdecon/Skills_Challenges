# 1. Describe the Problem
# Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.



# 2. Design the Class Interface
# Include the initializer and public methods with all parameters and return values.

# 3. Create Examples as Tests
# Make a list of examples of how the class will behave in different situations.
# Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go.


# 4. Implement the Behaviour
# After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
